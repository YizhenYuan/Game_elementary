This is a popular game in my elementary school and middle school. At that time, we can not bring phones to school. When we take a break, we usually play this game. Hence, I want to make an AI version to just memorize that.

This game has no game settings or background. (it is already very hard for children to create a game like this, nobody will care about the background at that time)

And the game rule is somehow following:
Player can be 2 to 6 (it could be more, while the rules still holds)
It is a turn-base game, everyone start from 0 energy. Player can hold evergy, attack, defend in one turn. And all player has their n-th term at same time. (so we clap to make rhythm and to check time) (also, since attack need energy and everyone start from 0, so everyone will hold energy in their first turn)

there are 4  kinds of attack which cause 1-4 energy. and their are 3 kinds of defend to defend attack, while the third defence cost one energy and the forth attack is not defendable. 

When any player was hitted, he/she quit game immediately and the other players start another round with all 0 energy.

An example of this game would be:
A/B/C want to play this game
A,B,C hold energy at first round
A hold energy at seconnd round, B attack with one energy, C defend for attack one
A dies, B/C start a new round
